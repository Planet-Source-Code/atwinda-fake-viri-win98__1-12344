### Description

This program is great FAKE(!!!!!!!!!!!!) Virus Installer. Ir will make some hardrive noises.. then once it gets to 100% boom! blue screen 3 times, and freeze... This only works in win98, and i haven't tested it in winME...

anyway, the only way to stop it (before it gets to 100) is to click the % sign, not teh numbers, the actaul % sign...

have fun with this.. don't use it the wrong way.. by all means scare the hell outta your room mate or something, but don't take it to far!

vote!!! please...
